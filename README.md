**Imagine having a personal health assistant available 24/7, ready to guide you on fitness, nutrition, and mental well-being. That's HealthPilot!** We've built an intelligent multi-agent system designed to provide holistic health advice, personalized plans, and helpful resources, all through a friendly chat interface.

Whether you're looking to get fit, eat healthier, or manage stress, HealthPilot acts as your knowledgeable guide, orchestrating specialized AI agents to deliver the best possible support.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** A central `HealthManager` intelligently routes your requests to specialized agents:
    * üèãÔ∏è **Fitness Agent:** Provides workout advice, exercise demonstrations (using real videos!), and helps create fitness plans.
    * üçé **Nutrition Agent:** Offers dietary guidance, finds healthy recipes based on your preferences (scraping from the web!), and breaks down nutritional info.
    * üß† **Mental Care Agent:** Supports emotional well-being, suggests calming music (from YouTube!), and provides guidance on stress management and sleep.
* **Interactive UI:** Built with [Chainlit](https://chainlit.io/) for a seamless and engaging chat experience, including custom UI elements for recipes and exercise videos.
* **Personalization:** Remembers user profile details (age, gender, height, weight) using a local SQLite database via the `UserProfileQueryPlugin` to tailor advice (where applicable).
* **External Tool Integration:** Leverages Semantic Kernel plugins to:
    * Scrape websites for fitness videos (`FitnessPlugin` using Playwright).
    * Search and extract recipes (`NutritionPlugin` using Playwright).
    * Find relevant music on YouTube (`MentalCarePlugin` using Pytube).
    * Send email summaries or confirmations (`SmtpPlugin` using Gmail).
    * *(Optional: Add ICS Calendar generation if implemented)*
* **Azure Powered:** Utilizes Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) and Azure AI Agents for robust AI capabilities and agent orchestration.
* **RAG-Powered Responses:** Each agent is enhanced with **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** using the **Knowledge feature** in Azure AI Foundry's Agent Service ‚Äî enabling more accurate, grounded, and domain-specific answers.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

HealthPilot employs a multi-agent architecture coordinated by Semantic Kernel. The user interacts with the Chainlit UI, sending messages to the central `HealthManager` agent. The `HealthManager` analyzes the request and routes it to the appropriate specialist agent (`Fitness`, `Nutrition`, or `MentalCare`). Specialist agents utilize their unique instructions and dedicated plugins (like web scraping, database queries, or music search) to fulfill the request, returning the information to the `HealthManager` and then back to the user via the Chainlit UI.

**Core Components:**

* **Chainlit:** Provides the frontend chat interface and manages user sessions.
* **Semantic Kernel:** Orchestrates the overall workflow, manages plugins, and interacts with AI models.
* **Azure AI Agents:** Hosts the specialized agents (Fitness, Nutrition, MentalCare) defined with specific instructions and tools (plugins). Uses GPT-4o.
* **Azure OpenAI Service:** Provides the underlying LLMs (GPT-4o-mini for the `HealthManager`).
* **Plugins:** Modular components (`.py` files in `/plugins`) that give agents specific skills (web scraping, database access, API calls, etc.).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Let's get HealthPilot running on your local machine!

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Version 3.10+ recommended.
* **Git:** To clone the repository.
* **Azure Account & Services:**
    * An active Azure subscription.
    * An Azure OpenAI resource with eg. **GPT-4o-mini** deployed (for the `HealthManager`).
    * An Azure AI Studio/Foundry project with three **Azure AI Agents** created using the eg. **GPT-4o** model (Fitness, Nutrition, MentalCare). Set agent prompts in `agents/*.py` files. Note the `Agent ID` for each. For each agent, upload the corresponding PDF from the `knowledge/` folder into the **Knowledge** section of Azure AI Studio to enable RAG-based responses:

| Agent            | Knowledge PDF File                                      | Description                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| FitnessAgent     | ACE-Personal-Trainer-Manual-PDFDrive-.pdf              | Exercise science and workout planning      |
| NutritionAgent   | Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf         | Official dietary guidance and nutrition    |
| MentalCareAgent  | therapists_guide_to_brief_cbtmanual.pdf                | Cognitive behavioral therapy and mental care |
